Give examples of:
1. Two events that are independent but NOT mutually exclusive
2. Two events that are mutually exclusive but NOT independent

## Quantitative Data

### Small Samples
 - Assumes population is normal
 - $\bar{x} ~ N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$

### Large Samples
 - $n \geq 30 (no assumptions)
 - $\bar{x} ~ N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$

## Qualitative Data
 - Large smaples only
 - np >= 10
 - n(1-p) >= 10
 - $\hat{p}$ - Sample Proportion (random variable)
 - $\hat{p} ~ N(\mu_{\hat{p}}=p, \sigma_{\hat{p}} = \frac{\sqrt{p(n-p)}{\sqrt{n}}})$
