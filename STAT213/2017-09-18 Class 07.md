## Probability

Founded in 1920's, by Russian Schools of Mathematicians

Random (chance) experiments:
 * Picking up a banana in a basket of fruit with 1/5 bananas and 4/5 other fruit
 * Gambling

Definition: Sample Space:
 * Set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
 * Most real life outcomes don't have a fixed sample space

Definition: Event:
 * Any subset in the S (sample space)
 * A single base experiment is a single event (such as rolling a single die)
 * Think of a event like a set. Allows us to use set theory.

Definition: Basic Counting Rule:
 * Also called multiplication rule
 * Rolling one dice once cause $6^1 = 6$ outcomes
 * Rolling two dice once cause $6^2 = 36$ outcomes
 * Rolling n dice once cause $6^n$ outcomes
 * For an event with N outcomes done M times, $N^M$ total outcomes

Assigning measures of uncertainty (long-run relative frequencies)
 * Rolling a die 6 times you can expect 1 6's, but you may not get it at all, the resulting percentage being way off.
 * Rolling a die 600 times you can expect roughly 100 6's, due to the probability averaging out.

Example 01: Basic Counting Rule:
 * Mary has 3 skits, 2 hats, and 5 t-shirts
 * There are thirty total outfits

Operations with Sets:
 * * Union: $A \cup B$
   - $A=\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}$
   - $B=\{3,\ 7,\ 10,\ 8\}$
   - $A \cup B=\{1,2,3,7,8,10\}$
 * * Intersection: $A \cap B$
   - $A=\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}$
   - $B=\{3,\ 7,\ 10,\ 8\}$
   - $A \cap B=\{3\}$
 * * Inclusion: $A \subseteq B$  
   - Order relationship  
   - A is subset of B
 * * Compliment of A: $A^C$
   - Sets in A but not B

De Morgan's Laws:
 * $(A \cup B)^C = A^C*B^2$
 * $(AB)^C = A^C \cup B^C$

Double Inclusive
 * $"c" let x \in (A \cup B)^C$ *

Definition: Mutually Exclusive Events:
 * Disjoint Sets (no overlap)
 * $|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |AB| - |AC| - |BC| + |ABC|$
