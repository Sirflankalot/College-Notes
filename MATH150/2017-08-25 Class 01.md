## Pre-Calc Overview

Definition: Set:
 * Well defined collection of objects
 * $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3...\}$

Definition: Function:
 * Page: 2
 * A function f is a rule that assigns to each element of the set D one called f(x) from the set E
 * D is the domain *(inputs)*
 * E is the range *(outputs)*

Example 1:
 * $D = Set of all students$
 * $E = \{15, 16... 60\}$
 * $f(x) = age\ of\ x$

Example 2:
 * $D = \{bread,\ avacado,\ fish,\ blueberry,\ cranberry,\ approcot,\ apple\}$
 * $E = \{a,\ b,\ c,\ d,\ e\ f\}$
 * $f(x) = first\ letter\ of\ word$

Yay! He referred to Computer Science!

$\mathbb{R}$ = Set of all real numbers

Definition: Domain:
 * Set of all real numbers for which the formula makes sence.

Example 3:
 * $f(x)=\frac{1}{x+3}$
 * $D(f)=\{x:x\neq-3\} = (-\infty, -3)\cup(-3,\infty)$

Example 4:
 * $f(x)=\sqrt{1-2x}=\{x:1-2x\geq0\}=\{x:x\leq\frac{1}{2}\}=(-\infty,\frac{1}{2}]$

Example 5:
 * $f(x)=\frac{1}{x+3}$
 * $Range(f)=\{y:y\neq0\}$

$$
f(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            -x, & if\ x \leq 0 \\
            x, & if\ x > 0
        \end{array}
    \right.
