### Euler's Formula

$V-e+f=2$

- V is verticies
- e is edges
- f is faces

Whenever you do anything to the graph, either you add a vertex and an edge or an edge and a face.

See graph on 1:2.

Graphs are just a list of edges between points

#### K5

A K5 is a graph with every single node connected and it can't be drawn without intersections

### Lazy Professor Problem

A professor doesn't want to grade their own test, so they give everyone a test randomly. What's the chance everyone doesn'tgets their own paper.

1/3 of random permutations, don't get their own paper if there is 3 people.

50 people is very hard as there are a lot of permutations.

The number of permutations for N things is $N!$

### Pi

$\Pi_{i=1}^{n}i$
